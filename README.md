# What is 3d-portfolio?

It is a highly customizable dev portfolio template that features astonishing 3D graphics by taking advantage of webGL.

It is built using [threejs](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), and [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei).

# Get started!

## First

Start by `forking` this repository, then clone your forked copy and navigate to the root directory.

## Install the dependencies with: 

### `yarn`

## Then start the development server with:

### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Modify the template to your taste.

There is no coding required to configure the pages of the portfolio. 
All the settings that you will ever need to touch are set inside the 

`src/configs.js`, `./constants/pageData.js`, and `src/theme.js`

And thats It! It will automatically deploy to `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`
